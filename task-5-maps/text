The Lady of Shalott
-- by Alfred, Lord Tennyson

Part 1

On either side the river lie
Long fields of barley and of rye,
That clothe the wold and meet the sky;
And thro' the field the road runs by
To many tower'd Camelot;
And up and down people go,
Gazing where the lilies blow
Round an island there below,
The island of Shalot.

Whilows whiten, aspens quiver,
Little breezes dusk and shiver
Thro' the road that runs for ever
By the island in the river
Flowing down to Camelot.
For gray walls, and for grey towers,
Overlook a space of flowers,
And the silent isle imbowers
The Lady of Shalott.
