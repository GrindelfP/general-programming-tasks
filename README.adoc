= General Programming tasks =

This is a repository, where I store the tasks on my General Programming university course. 


== Task 1 ==

This task is dedicated to implementation of a Stack data structure in C programming language. The task is divided in several parts:

1. stack with capability to store only integer nubers;
2. stack with capability to store any type of data.

The first part is completed in grindelf-stack-int header and source code files and simply stores integers as an array (a pointer to the integer value).

The second part is completed in grindelf-stack header and source code files and uses the 
[source, c]
----
void *
----
pointer to store the values of different types.
